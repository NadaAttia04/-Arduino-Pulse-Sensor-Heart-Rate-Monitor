# -Arduino-Pulse-Sensor-Heart-Rate-Monitor
A simple Arduino-based project that uses a pulse sensor to measure and display real-time heart rate (BPM) on a 16Ã—2 LCD screen.   This project demonstrates how to interface a pulse sensor with Arduino, process heartbeat data, and visualize results in an interactive and educational way.
